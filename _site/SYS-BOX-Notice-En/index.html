<p>SYS BOX is an application that integrates multiple functional notification widgets, with a minimalist design and excellent performance. It is powerful but not cumbersome.</p>

<p>You can easily access the following features by adding collection Widgets from SYS BOX to the “Today” page of the Notification Center:</p>

<p>–  Network traffic &amp; system information monitor widget
–  Important events widget
–  Quick starter widget
–  Network traffic monitor widget</p>

<p>SYS BOX provides professional users with common networking tools, such as Ping, DNS resolution, routing tracking, etc.</p>

<p>SYS BOX offers customizable features that not only allow you to change app’s icon, but also allow you to change the background of home page and add cool starry sky effects.</p>

<p>SYS BOX adapts to iOS 13’s dark mode in advance. You just click on the switch, and the Widgets on the Notification Center also adapt well to iOS 13’s dark mode.</p>
